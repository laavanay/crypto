Part B 1: To capture and analyze FTP login packets
between a client and server using Wireshark and
understand how credentials are transmitted over the
network.
Description:
✓ FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring
files between client and server.
✓ FTP typically uses port 21 for control commands.
✓ FTP transmits username and password in plaintext,
which can be easily captured.
✓ Wireshark is a packet-sniffing tool used to monitor
network traffic and analyze protocol behavior.
Tools Required:
✓ Kali Linux (Client)
✓ Ubuntu Linux (FTP Server)
✓ Wireshark
✓ FTP client (command line)
Part A — Setup FTP Server on Ubuntu—In Ubuntu
VM
1. Start Ubuntu VM.
2. Install FTP server:
sudo apt-get install vsftpd.
3. Start FTP service:
sudo systemctl start vsftpd.
4. Enable service on boot:
sudo systemctl enable vsftpd.
If the service is not running..
Sudo ufw allow 21/tcp
5. Create a test user:
sudo adduser ftpuser (password: 12345).
Part B — Capture Traffic Using Wireshark on Kali
7. Start Kali VM.
8. Launch Wireshark and select network interface
(eth0).
9. Start capture.
Part C — FTP Client Login
11.Open terminal on Kali: ftp <ubuntu-ip> (example:
ftp 192.168.56.105).
12.Enter username: ftpuser.
13.Enter password: 12345.
14.Optionally, execute a command like ls, pwd…
15.Exit FTP: bye.
16.Stop Wireshark capture.
Part D — Analyze Packets
17.Apply display filter: ftp.
18.Locate USER command packet → verify username.
19.Locate PASS command packet → verify password.
20.Check server responses:
• 331 User name okay, need password
• 230 Login successful
21.Observe the sequence of authentication packets.
Observations:
• Username and password appear in plaintext in
Wireshark.
• FTP packets can be filtered using tcp.port==21 or ftp.
• Server response codes are 331 (password required)
and 230 (login successful).
• The login sequence is clearly visible:
1. USER → ftpuser
2. Server → 331
3. PASS → 12345
4. Server → 230
