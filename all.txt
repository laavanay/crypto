🔹 Program 5 – RSA Encryption
1. What is RSA?
RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
2. Why is BigInteger used in RSA?
RSA uses very large numbers which cannot be stored in primitive data types.
3. What is the role of prime numbers in RSA?
Two large prime numbers are used to generate the public and private keys.
4. What is n in RSA?
n is the modulus obtained by multiplying two primes and is part of both keys.
5. What is Euler’s Totient Function?
It is φ(n) = (p−1)(q−1), used to compute the private key.
6. Why is 65537 commonly used as e?
It is a standard public exponent that provides good security and efficiency.
7. How is encryption done in RSA?
Ciphertext = Message^e mod n.
8. How is decryption done in RSA?
Message = Ciphertext^d mod n.
9. What happens if the primes are small?
RSA becomes insecure and can be easily broken.
10. Where is RSA used in real life?
HTTPS, digital signatures, secure email, and key exchange.

🔹 Program 6 – Leaky Bucket Algorithm
1. What is the Leaky Bucket algorithm?
It is a congestion control algorithm that regulates packet flow at a fixed rate.
2. Why is Leaky Bucket used?
To prevent network congestion and buffer overflow.
3. What does bucket capacity represent?
Maximum number of packets that can be stored.
4. What happens when the bucket overflows?
Incoming packets are dropped.
5. What is leak rate?
Number of packets sent per unit time.
6. Is Leaky Bucket used for traffic shaping or policing?
Traffic shaping.
7. What is packet drop?
Discarding packets when buffer is full.
8. What are the advantages of Leaky Bucket?
Smooth traffic, reduced congestion, fixed output rate.

🔹 Program 7 – RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
1. What is RPC?
A mechanism where a client executes a procedure on a remote server.
2. What protocol is used in your RPC program?
TCP using sockets.
3. What is accept()?
A blocking call that waits for a client connection.
4. Why are DataInputStream and DataOutputStream used?
To transmit primitive data types safely.
5. Who initiates communication in RPC?
The client.
6. What happens if server is not running?
Client gets “Connection refused”.
7. What operations does the server support?
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
8. Why is division by zero handled?
To prevent runtime errors.

🔹 Program 8 – Peer-to-Peer Application
1. What is Peer-to-Peer communication?
Peers communicate directly without a central server.
2. How is this program peer-to-peer?
Each peer can act as both client and server.
3. Why is EOF used?
To indicate end of file transmission.
4. What happens if EOF is not sent?
Client waits indefinitely.
5. What type of socket is used?
TCP socket.
6. What happens if shared.txt is missing?
Server throws FileNotFoundException.
7. What is the role of BufferedReader?
To read file contents line by line.

🔹 GENERAL NETWORKING QUESTIONS
1. What is a port?
A logical communication endpoint.
2. What is a socket?
Combination of IP address and port number.
3. Difference between TCP and UDP?
TCP is reliable; UDP is faster but unreliable.
4. What is a blocking call?
A call that waits until an event occurs.
